\subsection*{Introduction}

As student's that took intro to CS at Williams, we learned how to program with Python. There were, of course, many benefits to learning 
how to code this way. For example, Python syntax, at the level that we were learning it, was not difficult to learn. However, there were 
also many challenges -- especially for individuals that have never coded before or have only had experience coding with languages like 
Scratch. One of the main challenges that we came across as students in 134, was trying to gain a solid foundational understanding of the 
specifications in a language. Python is obviously a large language with many specifications which is daunting to people that have never
programmed before. \\
\\
BASIC is a programming language that was originally designed to remedy this problem. Designed by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz at 
Dartmouth College in 1963 as a way to make it easy for non-STEM students to learn how to code. For our project, we are looking to create 
an even simpler version of the language that will hopefully further lower the barriers of entry to learning how to the program and really 
reinforce what we believe to be the foundations of programming. 

\subsection*{Design Principles}

Because Basic BASIC is meant to be accessible even to most non-technical of users, both our primitive types and our combining forms will 
try to resemble plain English as much as possible. Furthermore, Basic BASIC will have even fewer specifications than BASIC. Having a 
small set of primitive types and limited data structures, allows the user to gain a stronger understanding of "foundational" concepts which 
will lend itself nicely if the user chooses to continue learning how to program. 

\subsection*{Examples}

Note: The file extensions are a work in progress

\begin{enumerate}
    \item
    test1.txt:

    \begin{verbatim}
    PRINT "Hello World"
    \end{verbatim}

    Run ”dotnet run test1.txt” in the project file. The output should be the following:

    \begin{verbatim}
    "Hello World"
    \end{verbatim} 


    \item
    test2.txt:

    \begin{verbatim}
    PRINT "gibberish"
    \end{verbatim}

    Run ”dotnet run test2.txt” in the project file. The output should be the following:

    \begin{verbatim}
    gibberish
    \end{verbatim}

    \item
    example-3.bb: 

    \begin{verbatim}
    "Programming is cool!"
    \end{verbatim}

    Run ”dotnet run test3.txt” in the project file. The output should be the following:

    \begin{verbatim}
    "Programming is cool!"
    \end{verbatim}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Language Concepts}

For now, the user needs only to understand strings and print statements. Strings are a primitive data type in this language meaning they 
cannot be broken down into constiuent parts. The print statment, on the other hand, is a combining form that acts as an 'operation' which 
takes a string and does something with it (in this case, prints it on screen). \\
\\
As we continue with our language, we will incorporate other elements of the language like GO TO or INPUT. Once again, the goal of Basic 
BASIC is to be easy to learn and program with. All types be it primitives or combining forms should resemble plain English as much as 
possible. 

\subsection*{Formal Syntax}

\begin{verbatim}
<Expr>     := <Command>_<String>
           | <String>
           | \epsilon
<Command>  := PRINT
<String>   := ""
\end{verbatim}
